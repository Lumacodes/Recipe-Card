Recipe Card Project

Hey! I made this simple recipe card web page to practice HTML and CSS — nothing fancy, just a clean card showing a salad picture, difficulty level, and star ratings.

I’m still learning, so I kept it straightforward. Played around with flexbox, hover effects, and styling images.

I’m running this on my Arch Linux setup using Hyprland (Wayland compositor) and Illogical Impulse for screenshots — so if you see some neat screenshots in my repo, that’s the tool I’m using!

Open the index.html file in your browser to see it live. No setup needed.

Feel free to fork or improve it — feedback or tips are always welcome!
