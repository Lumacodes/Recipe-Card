# Recipe Card Project

Hey there!

This is a simple recipe card web page I built to practice **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It’s a clean, minimal card showcasing a salad picture, difficulty level, and star ratings.

## About This Project

I’m still learning, so I kept it straightforward — using **flexbox**, **hover effects**, and some image styling.  
It’s a great starting point if you want to build or customize your own recipe cards!

I use **Arch Linux** btw!
